== Hacker News HireFest (WIP)

Status: Work In Progress

Hacker News has a monthly "Who Is Hiring" post where companies can leave details regarding job information. Unfortunately, this information is not organized at all.

Using the Hacker News API hosted on Algolia (https://hn.algolia.com/api), this app will pull the job posting data, parse it into relevant chunks (Company Name, location, website, email, keywords) and let job seekers organize the results in a more efficient manner.
